      As a software engineer, I am excited to bring my analytical skills and technical proficiency to the tech industry. My background in healthcare has shaped my problem-solving approach, communication skills, and ability to perform under pressureâ€”all qualities I bring to the tech industry.

      With five years of experience in interventional radiology, I've developed strong skills in collaborating with multi-disciplinary teams, adapting to rapidly changing environments, and critical decision-making. My ability to learn quickly and navigate ambiguity led to my selection as a tutor and preceptor, where I enhanced my communication abilities and nurtured a passion for continuous learning.

      I am eager to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with dynamic teams. Let's connect and explore how we can achieve great things together.
